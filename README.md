# ProxyTSPRD

Distributed-memory implementation of a proxy application for analyzing and characterizing performance of dynamical systems using Tensorflow, PyTorch and Horovod.

## Acknowledgement

In order to capture the fidelities of the original application, we perform the same data transformations used in an actual application for grid prediction, namely deepDMD: https://github.com/pnnl/grid_prediction.
